Research on human computation has shown the effectiveness of crowdsourcing for scaling out human work by defining a large number of microtasks which can easily be distributed and executed. However, microtask design for music transcription is a research area that remains unaddressed. This paper focuses on the design of a crowdsourcing task to detect errors in a score transcription which can be deployed in either automated or human-driven transcription workflows. We conduct an experiment where we study two design parameters: 1) the size of the score to be annotated and 2) the modality in which it is presented in the user interface. We analyze the performance and reliability of non-specialised crowdworkers on Amazon Mechanical Turk with respect to these design parameters, differentiated by worker experience and types of transcription errors. Results are encouraging, and pave the way for scalable and efficient crowdassisted music transcription systems.","tags":null,"title":"Microtask crowdsourcing for music score Transcriptions: an experiment with error detection","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1572393600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572393600,"objectID":"5f04702f3ee56c09c61ee4f2c46c101a","permalink":"http://www.andreamauri.com/project/join/","publishdate":"2019-10-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/join/","section":"project","summary":"This project aims to investigate to what extent social (big) data can be used to help to identify NEEts and inform policies for improving their integration with the society.

To motivate people to change their energy consumption behavior, we need to have a thorough understanding of which energy-consuming activities they perform and how these are performed. Traditional sources of information about energy consumption, such as smart sensor devices and surveys, can be costly to set up, may lack contextual information, have infrequent updates, or are not publicly accessible. In this paper, we propose to use social media as a complementary source of information for understanding energy-consuming activities. A huge amount of social media posts are generated by hundreds of millions of people every day, they are publicly available, and provide real-time data often tagged to space and time. We design an ontology to get a better understanding of the energy-consuming activities domain and develop a text and image processing pipeline to extract from social media the description of energy-consuming activities. We run a case study on Istanbul and Amsterdam. We highlight the strength and weakness of our approach, showing that social media data has the potential to be a complementary source of information for describing energy-consuming activities.","tags":null,"title":"Automatic Processing of User-Generated Content for the Description of Energy-Consuming Activities at Individual and Group Level","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marco Brambilla","Stefano Ceri","Florian  Daniel","Marco  Di Giovanni","Andrea  Mauri","Giorgia  Ramponi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1524441600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1524441600,"objectID":"4ac10dfbfe5b3300331cf25b4f21bbf1","permalink":"http://www.andreamauri.com/publication/2018www_knowledge/","publishdate":"2018-04-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2018www_knowledge/","section":"publication","summary":"Knowledge in the world continuously evolves, and ontologies are largely incomplete, especially regarding data belonging to the so-called long tail. We propose a method for discovering emerging knowledge by extracting it from social content. Once initialized by domain experts, the method is capable of finding relevant entities by means of a mixed syntactic-semantic method. The method uses seeds, i.e. prototypes of emerging entities provided by experts, for generating candidates; then, it associates candidates to feature vectors built by using terms occurring in their social content and ranks the candidates by using their distance from the centroid of seeds, returning the top candidates. Our method can run iteratively, using the results as new seeds. as new seeds. In this paper we address the following research questions: (1) How does the reconstructed domain knowledge evolve if the candidates of one extraction are recursively used as seeds (2) How does the reconstructed domain knowledge spread geographically (3) Can the method be used to inspect the past, present, and future of knowledge (4) Can the method be used to find emerging knowledge","tags":null,"title":"Iterative Knowledge Extraction from Social Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andrea Mauri","Achilleas Psyllidis","Alessandro Bozzon"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1524441600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1524441600,"objectID":"8b245a923ba6005c286132e0db467cd4","permalink":"http://www.andreamauri.com/publication/2018www_ssm_demo/","publishdate":"2018-04-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2018www_ssm_demo/","section":"publication","summary":"Having a thorough understanding of energy consumption behavior is an important element of sustainability studies.

Each driver has his own driving style, which could impact safety, fuel economy and road congestion. Knowledge about the driving style of the driver could be used to encourage “better” driving behaviour through immediate feedback while driving, or by scaling auto insurance rates based on the aggressiveness of the driving style. In this work we report on our study of driving behaviour profiling based on unsupervised data mining methods. The main goal is to detect the different driving behaviours, and thus to cluster drivers with similar behaviour. This paves the way to new business models related to the driving sector, such as Pay-How-You-Drive insurance policies and car rentals. Driver behavioral characteristics are studied by collecting information from GPS sensors on the cars and by applying three different analysis approaches (DP-means, Hidden Markov Models, and Behavioural Topic Extraction) to the contextual scene detection problems on car trips, in order to detect different behaviour along each trip. Subsequently, drivers are clustered in similar profiles based on that and the results are compared with a human-defined groundtruth on drivers classification. The proposed framework is tested on a real dataset containing sampled car signals. While the different approaches show relevant differences in trip segment classification, the coherence of the final driver clustering results is surprisingly high.","tags":null,"title":"Comparison of different driving style analysis approaches based on trip segmentation over GPS information","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marco Brambilla","Jordi Cabot","Andrea Mauri","Javier Luis Cánovas Izquierdo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1508544000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1508544000,"objectID":"3233c034d1605485e96a73e7c074f1b7","permalink":"http://www.andreamauri.com/publication/2017sle_crowdmoedling/","publishdate":"2017-10-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2017sle_crowdmoedling/","section":"publication","summary":"Crowdsourcing has emerged as a novel paradigm where humans are employed to perform computational tasks. In the context of Domain-Specific Modeling Language (DSML) development, where the involvement of end-users is crucial to assure that the resulting language satisfies their needs, crowdsourcing tasks could be defined to assist in the language definition process. By relying on the crowd, it is possible to show an early version of the language to a wider spectrum of users, thus increasing the validation scope and eventually promoting its acceptance and adoption. We propose a systematic method for creating crowdsourcing campaigns aimed at refining the graphical notation of DSMLs. The method defines a set of steps to identify, create and order the questions for the crowd. As a result, developers are provided with a set of notation choices that best fit end-users’ needs.

However, the app design is frequently made only for one of the two (i.e., mobile first or web first) while missing an appropriate design for the other (which, in turn, simply mimics the interaction of the first one). This results into poor quality of the interaction on one or the other platform. Current solutions would require different designs, to be realized through different design methods and tools, and that may require to double development and maintenance costs. In order to mitigate such an issue, this paper proposes a novel approach that supports the design of both web and mobile applications at once. Starting from a unique requirement and business specification, where web-- and mobile--specific aspects are captured through tagging, we derive a platform-independent design of the system specified in IFML. This model is subsequently refined and detailed for the two platforms, and used to automatically generate both the web and mobile versions. If more precise interactions are needed for the mobile part, a blending with MobML, a mobile-specific modeling language, is devised.

Interaction with the crowds was originally confined to specifically designed crowdsourcing platforms, such as Amazon Mechanical Turk. More recently, crowd-based computing has been reconsidered and extended, targeting social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn, or including basic and direct interaction mechanisms, such as routing personal emails or tweets. Crowdsearcher, the system presented here, fosters interoperability and adaptation in crowd-based applications -- for example, the ability of supporting multiplatform applications and adapting them in reaction to events. This approach specifically supports dynamic interoperability (that is, the ability to modify the execution platforms while the application is ongoing) as a reaction to crowd behavior, which is hardly predictable. The authors show how to specify interoperability control at a high, declarative level and then implement it using active rules, thereby obtaining answers from crowds engaged in different communities.

The outcome will be a framework based on model-driven approach that will allow end user to develop their own application with a fraction of the effort required by the traditional approaches. It will guarantee a strong control of the execution of the crowdsourcing task by mean of a declarative specification of objectives and quality measures.

Most crowdsourcing systems only provide limited and predefined controls; in contrast, we present an approach to crowdsourcing which provides fine-level, powerful and flexible controls. We model each crowdsourcing application as composition of elementary task types and we progressively transform these high level specifications into the features of a reactive execution environment that supports task planning, assignment and completion as well as performer monitoring and exclusion. Controls are specified as active rules on top of data structures which are derived from the model of the application; rules can be added, dropped or modified, thus guaranteeing maximal flexibility with limited effort. We also report on our prototype platform that implements the proposed framework and we show the results of our experimentations with different rule sets, demonstrating how simple changes to the rules can substantially affect time, effort and quality involved in crowdsourcing activities.","tags":null,"title":"Reactive Crowdsourcing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marco Brambilla","Alessandro Bozzon","Stefano Ceri","Andrea Mauri"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1338508800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1338508800,"objectID":"095089f38869480949cd736b3fc55f75","permalink":"http://www.andreamauri.com/publication/2012seco_crowd/","publishdate":"2012-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2012seco_crowd/","section":"publication","summary":"In many settings, the human opinion provided by an expert or knowledgeable user can be more useful than factual information retrieved by a search engine. Search systems do not capture the subjective opinions and recommendations of friends, or fresh, online-provided information that require contextual or domain-specific expertise. Search results obtained from conventional search engines can be complemented by crowdsearch, an online interaction with crowds, selected among friends, experts, or people who are presently at a given location; an interplay between conventional and search-based queries can occur, so that the two search methods can support each other. In this paper, we use a model-driven approach for specifying and implementing a crowdsearch application; in particular we define two models: the “Query Task Model”, representing the meta-model of the query that is submitted to the crowd and the associated answers; and the “User Interaction Model”, showing how the user can interact with the query model to fulfil her needs. Our solution allows for a top-down design approach, from the crowd-search task design, down to the crowd answering system design.

Social networking requirements are becoming a core part of the needs of modern enterprises too, which need ad-hoc Web platforms that incorporate the right set of social features for their business. This leads to the need to provide facilities and methods for developing such socially enabled applications. In this paper we propose a model-driven approach that is specifically focused on the development of Web applications that exploit social features. In particular, we describe an extension of the WebML notation (a Domain Specific Language designed to model Web applications), comprising a set of modeling concepts that encapsulate the logic of the interaction with the social platforms. Upon this, we define a set of design patterns that respond to the typical needs of enterprises and we show some sample application scenarios.","tags":null,"title":"Model-driven development of social network enabled applications with WebML and social primitives","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marco Brambilla","Alessandro Bozzon","Andrea Mauri"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1333756800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1333756800,"objectID":"336a9a5f8816b921a13f1b39c1541439","permalink":"http://www.andreamauri.com/publication/2012crowdsearcher/","publishdate":"2012-04-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2012crowdsearcher/","section":"publication","summary":"Even though search systems are very efficient in retrieving world-wide information, they can not capture some peculiar aspects and features of user needs, such as subjective opinions and recommendations, or information that require local or domain specific expertise. In this kind of scenario, the human opinion provided by an expert or knowledgeable user can be more useful than any factual information retrieved by a search engine. In this paper we propose a model-driven approach for the specification of crowd-search tasks, i.e. activities where real people – in real time – take part to the generalized search process that involve search engines. In particular we define two models: the “Query Task Model”, representing the metamodel of the query that is submitted to the crowd and the associated answers; and the “User Interaction Model”, which shows how the user can interact with the query model to fulfill her needs.
