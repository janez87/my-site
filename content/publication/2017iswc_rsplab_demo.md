abstract = "RSPlab is an infrastructure that reduces the effort required to design and execute reproducible experiments as well as share their results. It provides a programmatic environment to deploy RDF Streams and RSP engines, interact with them and continuously monitor their performances and collect statistics. In this demo weâ€™ll show how to deploy RDFStream and RSP engines in the cloud and how to interact with them registering and unregistering continuous queries lively. We will show how these action impact the performances and we transform the results in visual plot on a chart."
