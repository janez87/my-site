abstract = "RDF Stream Processing (RSP) bridges the gap between semantic technologies and data stream systems. Although a number of RSP systems have been recently proposed, no RDF streams are actually made publicly available on the Web. To cope with this, RSP engines require ad-hoc wrappers in order to be fed from non-RDF streams available on the Internet. In this paper we present TripleWave: an approach for publishing existing streams on the Web as RDF streams, using mappings to perform live transformation of data, and following the Linked Data principles. We implemented and deployed TripleWave for a concrete use-case: a live feed of updates of Wikipedia"
