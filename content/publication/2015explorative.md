abstract = "Crowdsourcing applications are becoming widespread; they cover very different scenarios, including opinion mining, multimedia data annotation, localised information gathering, marketing campaigns, expert response gathering, and so on. The quality of the outcome of these applications depends on different design parameters and constraints, and it is very hard to judge about their combined effects without doing some experiments; on the other hand, there are no experiences or guidelines that tell how to conduct experiments, and thus these are often conducted in an ad-hoc manner, typically through adjustments of an initial strategy that may converge to a parameter setting which is quite different from the best possible one. In this paper we propose a comparative, explorative approach for designing crowdsourcing tasks. The method consists of defining a representative set of execution strategies, then execute them on a small dataset, then collect quality measures for each candidate strategy, and finally decide the strategy to be used with the complete dataset."
