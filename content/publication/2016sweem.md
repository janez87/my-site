abstract = "The growth of social media and the resulting increase of user generated content attracted people coming from different fields interested in analyzing this kind of data. Recently user generated content has been used for environmental monitoring. In this paper, we propose a model-driven approach for developing social media applications for environmental monitoring that will provide a simplified solution for integrating various data sources, exploiting different platforms and allowing complex data analysis to be performed."
