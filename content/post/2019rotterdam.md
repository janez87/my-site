On the 10th of October I gave a presentation for the Rotterdam Knowledge Lab of Urban Big Data on my work where I explored if and how new sources from the internet could complement conventional sources to study NEETs. 

My research focuses on user-generated content posted to the dedicated r/NEET group on the platform Reddit, which gathers about 4800 subscribers who self-identify as NEETs. I developed and implemented a new method to assess the behavioral patterns and main concerns of the NEETs that are present in this data.
