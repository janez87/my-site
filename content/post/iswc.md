Form the 20th to the 26th of October I'll be at the International Semantic Web Conference held in Vienna.

I'll be presenting the demo **Stressless RSP Benchmarking with RSPLab**, which will show how RSPLab enables design of experiments using a programmatic interface that allows deploying the environment, running experiments, measuring the performance, visualizing the results.
