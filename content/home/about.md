# Biography

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher within Web Information System group at the Delft University of Technology. Here I work in the context of the JOIN “Big Data for Evidence-based Youth Policy” project, which aims to investigate to what extent social (big) data can be used to help to identify NEETs and inform policies for improving their integration with the society.

My current research interest lies in data science, applied machine learning, and human-computation. In particular, my effort is devoted to the design, implementation and evaluation of novel computational methods and tools, focusing on humans in the loop and data science techniques. Drawing from the expansion of the user-generated data landscape, caused by the proliferation of Web technologies and the increased affordability of IoT devices, I am interested in applying this body of knowledge in the design and development of tools to study and address problems of societal relevance.

To this end, I researched AI based solutions to extract meaningful information from user generated content and how to combine them with traditional user centered design methods. Domains of interest I investigated include sustainability, mental health, vulnerable groups of people, digital libraries and privacy

In my research, I'm interested in addressing the following challenges:

- Efficiency and Effectiveness of AI: AI-based solutions need to be able to exploit and combine a large variety of diverse and heterogeneous data sources, including different media, different data formats with a diverse granularity in both space and time. This includes both studying new AI algorithms and investigating how to effectively involve human intelligence to cope with the limitations of AI.
- Data integration: information retrieved with AI needs to be integrated with the data obtained with traditional approaches. To this end it is crucial to investigate the characteristics of the two approaches to complement their weaknesses. Here not only we face the problem of integrating heterogeneous data, but also issues related to the intrinsic differences due to their different natures (e.g., lab studies controlled environment vs free forum discussions; strict experimental protocol vs chaos in social media)
- Process integration: to ensure AI is used at its fullest it is crucial  to  investigate how and where it can be embedded within the design process. AI can be envisioned as a tool to be used in parallel to traditional investigation methods, or support and drive the design process itself.
