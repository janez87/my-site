# Biography

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher within Web Information System group at the Delft University of Technology. Here I work in the context of the JOIN “Big Data for Evidence-based Youth Policy” project, which aims to investigate to what extent social (big) data can be used to help to identify NEEts and inform policies for improving their integration with the society.

My  main research interests include the study, design, implementation and evaluation of novel methods and tools for Web information systems engineering and Web data management, focusing on human in the loop and data science techniques for better understanding societal problems and provide stakeholders with instruments to address those issues
