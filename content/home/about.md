# Biography

Andrea Mauri is a PostDoc Researcher at the Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment, Department of Management in Built Environment in the Research Group of Urban Development Management.
He works in the context of the BOLD Cities project, which aims to use big data research to help find solutions for urban problems. 

Previously he was a PostDoc Researcher at the Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria (DEIB) of the
Politecnico di Milano in the DataScience Group where he studied models, methods and technologies for Crowdsourcing and
Human Computation, with special attention to problems related to: crowd and social networks integration,
adaptation and control of crowdsourcing task. He also studied model-driven software engineering, with particular focus on language specification and model transformations, and in the definition of business process-based applications integrated with social network practices.

His main research interests include smart city sensing and social content analysis. 
In particular he is interested in applying data science techniques for integrating heterogeneous data sources coming from different channels (e.g., phone data, energy consumption, social network, etc..) in order to discover knowledge that would remain hidden otherwise.

He is also interested in RDF Stream Processing with particular focus on publishing streams on the web and benchmarking.
