# Project summary to display on homepage.
summary = "BOLD cities use all kinds of data generated by - among others - sensor technologies, social media or classic census data. The emerging urban data landscape is diverse and complex, and involves big data as well as open or linked data. It includes data that is personal and impersonal, individual and aggregate, historical and real time, and so on. It raises questions about storage, analytics, presentation and visualization, but also about appropriate data-governance and management, and particularly about the social and individual consequences of the urban data revolution for people in the city."
