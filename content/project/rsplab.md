# Project summary to display on homepage.
summary = "In Stream Reasoning (SR), empirical research on RDF Stream Processing (RSP) is attracting a growing attention. The SR community proposed methodologies and benchmarks to investigate the RSP solution space and improve existing approaches. RSPLab is an infrastructure that reduces the effort required to design and execute reproducible experiments as well as share their results. It integrates two existing RSP benchmarks (LSBench and CityBench) and two RSP engines (C-SPARQL engine and CQELS)."
