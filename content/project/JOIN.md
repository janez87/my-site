summary = "This project aims to investigate to what extent social (big) data can be used to help to identify NEEts and inform policies for improving their integration with the society. The study of NEETs with conventional data sources has been particularly challenging, because the majority of people belonging to this group are often difficult to record in, or even excluded from official records."
